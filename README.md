First project to start implementing javascript in TOP.

This project is divided into several parts, and this is the first part, where it's mostly about laying down the foundations, for the upcoming touch-ups.

Added event handlers and dom manipulation as the second part.

**didn't style the project, as personally, the main focus here is to implement js.
